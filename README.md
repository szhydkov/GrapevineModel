# Learning through the Grapevine

This repository provides the code to accompany the AAMAS 2023 paper "The Grapevine Web: Analysing the Spread of False Information in Social Networks with Corrupted Sources" by Jacques Bara, Charlie Pilgrim, Paolo Turrini and Stanislav Zhydkov. 

`GrapevineModel.jl` provides to back end code for the model and other functions used in the notebooks.

The main tutorial notebook is `network_learning.ipynb`. 

Other notebooks provide experiments and analysis of model, including those included in the paper.

To run it you only need the following:

1. Julia: https://julialang.org/downloads/
2. Jupyter Notebook: https://jupyter.org/install
3. IJulia package for Julia: https://datatofish.com/add-julia-to-jupyter/

Any issues should be directed to s.zhydkov@warwick.ac.uk.
